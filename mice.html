	<h2><strong>Pet Mice</strong></h2>
   <p>'Pet Mice' (also known as 'Fancy mice') are <strong>the domesticated form of the house mouse </strong> (<em>Mus musculus domesticus</em>). There is a fascinating variety of their colours. Fancy mice can be white, black, brown, spotted, grey, gold or even multi-tonal. They are friendly, curious and highly social. Pet mice live in groups in which they care for each other and do not enjoy phsyical contact with humans - although there are fancy mice which will climb your hand. But otherwise than rats they are just pets to observe, not to touch or pet too much.<br><br>
   I started to have mice as pets in 2015 when I legally rescued 7 male albino baby mice who were held in a laboratory of my university for experiments. Since then I gave dozens of mice from rescue centers a new home. Currently I have 5 mice - 4 are female albinos and one is a male black mouse. <br><br> 
   At least there must be 4 mice in a group, therefore when the next mouse dies I have to increase the number of mice so they can have a naturally big group. My self-built cage with 3 1/2 floors is big enough for 15 mice, but mostly I just held 12 mice in it.
