	<h2><strong>Axolotl</strong></h2>
	   <p><strong>Mexican axolotl salamanders (<em>Ambystoma mexicanum</em>) are amphibians</strong> that spend their whole lives underwater. They exist in the wild in only one place - the lake complex of Xochimilco.<br><br> I had three axolotls - two wild type ones named Penny and Peanut and a leucistic one named Mrs Vanilla. Wild type axolotls are dark grayish green with black and olive mottling. Leucistic axolotls have a translucent white body, pink gills and dark eyes. They often get mistaken for the albino type, but those don't have any pigments and their eyes are red.<br><br> Unfortunately the two wild type axolotls passed away in the last years, so the only one left is the leucistic axolotl, but it will get two new companions soon.
