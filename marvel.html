	<h2><strong>Marvel</strong></h2>
      <p>If you like superheroes then you probably also like superhero movies. The <em>Marvel Cinematic Universe</em> (MCU) - <strong>a media franchise centered on superheroes based on the Marvel comics</strong> - started with the movie 'Iron Man' in 2008 and currently there exist 28 movies in the MCU. There are also many short films, television shows, games in many variations, comics and more.<br><br> Before the MCU started I obviously knew about superheroes like Hulk, Thor and Spider-Man from older movies or television shows. But with the MCU a whole new universe started where all the characters and stories are connected with each other. Sometimes you have to watch a lot of existing movies or television shows of the MCU to understand certain aspects of a new MCU movie.<br><br>I inhale every information that has to do with Marvel and I'm always very excited for new MCU movies and shows. I guess I - and a lot of other people - love the MCU because of the interconnected universe and the on-point tone as well as the mostly very human superheroes that have their own problems.</p><br>
