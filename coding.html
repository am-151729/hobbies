	<h2><strong>Coding</strong></h2>
      <p>As a Digital Native my interests have always been to work with the electronic brain that is a computer. I grew up in a household where my father has always been on track for the latest technical devices and thus, I had early access to a PC and the World Wide Web. Now, that I have been working for almost 15 years with computers in my business jobs, my interest to technical devices like laptops, tablets or mobile phones and especially the internet is greater than ever before. <br><br> When I studied Environmental Engineering and Resource Management I attended a computer science course and got first insights to JAVA and learned to program few things. I really liked it and even though I changed my study subject, I experienced those impressions to the programming world as overly positive. <br><br> In the last month I spent a lot of hours of my freetime for Tutorials and Workshops to get a glimpse on web development, especially for HTML and CSS. I already coded on online coding games, built my first website with a CMS and coded my first business card on replit with the help of an HTML & CSS workshop. <br><br> I really like to code and I am super motivated to learn more of the languages for the information highway. That's why I applied for the Web Development bootcamp at TechLabs in Dortmund to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p><br>
